Crash: Util.resizeBitmap() called on NULL bitmap.
	bitmap was TargetApple.ourImgDefault

CaterpillarMain.adjustResources() called before initResources()
	started from GameBoard.run()-initGame()

Where is the GameBoard thread started?
	from CaterpillarGame.onResume()

Where is the GameBoard thread initialized?
	from CaterpillarMain.onCreate()

CaterpillarMain is the primary startup activity, so onCreate() is always called at app startup.
CaterpillerGame is the game activity, started when the user clicks the START button.

Conclusions:
	It's impossible at startup for adjustResources() to be called before initResources()
	The only way this crash can happen, is if the resources were de-initialized.
	Thus, ourImgDefault must have been set to null.
	But the only place it's set to null, is in TargetApple.freeResources()
	And that is called only when the entire app is exiting

Where is TargetApple.ourImgDefault set to null?
	TargetApple.freeResources()
	called from CaterpillarMain.freeResources()
	called from CaterpillarMain.onPause(), if isFinishing() is true
